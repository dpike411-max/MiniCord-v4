# MiniCord - Offline Discord-style PWA Chatbot

This is a single-folder Progressive Web App (PWA) you can drop into a GitHub repository or host locally.
It provides a simple offline chatbot UI and can be added to your phone's home screen.

## Files
- index.html — main app
- style.css — Discord-inspired styling
- script.js — simple offline chatbot logic
- manifest.json — PWA manifest
- sw.js — lightweight service worker (caches core files)
- icons/icon-192.png, icons/icon-512.png — app icons

## Usage
1. Clone or unzip the project.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox for best PWA install support).
3. On mobile, use "Add to Home Screen" to install the app.
4. Works offline after first load thanks to the service worker.

## Customize
- Edit `script.js` to add more canned responses or plug in a local model.
- Replace icons in `icons/` with your own artwork.

Enjoy — and if you want extra features (more lifelike replies, conversation memory, emoji, themes), tell me what you want next!
